INDI Astroberry 1.0
=================================
This package provides the INDI drivers for Raspberry Pi devices:
* Astroberry Focuser - stepper motor driver with autospeed feature
* Astroberry GPS - GPS driver for scope location and time synchronization
* Astroberry AltIMU - accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro, atmospheric pressure sensor driver
* Astroberry Board - power switch board allowing for remote powering on/off up to 4 devices.
* Astroberry Mosaic - mosaic setup and run

Requirements
============
* INDI available here http://sourceforge.net/p/indi/code/HEAD/tree/trunk/
* libgps (for Astroberry GPS only) available here https://github.com/wdalmut/libgps
* RTIMULib (for Astroberry AltIMU only) available here https://github.com/richards-tech/RTIMULib
# bcm2835 (for Astroberry Focuser and Astroberry Board) available here http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/

Installation
============
See INSTALL

Source
===========
http://astroberry.sourceforge.net

How to Use
==========
Once installed, the Astroberry INDI drivers can be used by an INDI client such as
KStars (Ekos) or OpenPHD. It can also be used manually by invoking it via the 
indi_server:
$ indi_server indi_rpialtimu indi_rpigps indi_rpifocus indi_rpibrd indi_mosaic


Important!!!
============
Astroberry drivers are dedicated for controlling Raspberry Pi based devices. Drivers access various GPIO pins. Make sure 
that you use appropriate hardware devices connected to correct Raspberry Pi GPIO pins before running these drivers.
See Hardware specs below for detailed hardware and wiring instructions.

Hardware specs for Astroberry drivers
======================================
All devices have been connected to Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Jenny

1. Astroberry Board
* Power switch board - YwRobot 4 relay connected to Raspberry Pi (40 GPIO pins available)
  GPIO05 - IN1
  GPIO06 - IN2
  GPIO13 - IN3
  GPIO26 - IN4
  Four IN pins, each switching ON/OFF a power line:
  * IN1 - 5V to any usb powered device (connecting to Raspberry Pi enables hard reset)
  * IN2 - 5V to any usb powered device
  * IN3 - 0-12V any special device e.g. DSLR - Canon EOS 600D requires 7,4V
  * IN4 - 12V any device such as NEQ6 mount
  Note: All inputs are set to HIGH by default. YwRobot board requires input to be LOW to swich ON a line.

2. Astroberry Focuser
* Stepper motor - PG2528-0502U 5V 0.2A 0,5Nm (with builtin gear 76:1)
* Stepper motor controller - Low-Voltage DRV8834 10,8V 2A.
  Wiring Raspberry Pi to the motor controller:
  GPIO04 - DIR
  GPIO17 - STEP
  GPIO22 - M0
  GPIO27 - M1
  GPIO23 - SLEEP
  Note: Make sure you connect the stepper motor correctly to the controller (B2, B1 and A2, A1 pins on the controller).
        Remember to protect the 5V power line connected to VMOT pin on the motor controller with 100uF capacitor.

3. Astroberry AltIMU
* AltIMU-10 v4 Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, and Altimeter (L3GD20H, LSM303D, and LPS25H Carrier)
  Device connected to IÂ²C pins on Raspberry Pi:
  GPIO02 - SDA
  GPIO03 - SCL
  Note: Make sure that I2C is active on your Raspberry Pi (check with i2cdetect -y 1|0)

4. Astroberry GPS
* Adafruit Ultimate GPS MTK3339 (including RT clock with backup battery).
 Device wired to Raspberry Pi in the following way:
 GPIO14 - RX
 GPIO15 - TX
 GPIO23 - EN (not supported yet by driver)
 GPIO24 - PPS (not supported yet by driver)

5. Astroberry Mosaic
No additional hardware used.
Note: You must set the names of your ccd and mount before compiling the driver.
      Look for MYCCD in rpi_shot.cpp and MYSCOPE in rpi_goto.cpp
