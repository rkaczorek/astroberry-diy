INDI Astroberry 1.0.4
=================================
This package provides the INDI drivers for Raspberry Pi devices:
* Astroberry Focuser - stepper motor driver with absolute and relative position capabilities and autofocus with INDI client such as KStars and Ekos
* Astroberry GPS - GPS driver for easy scope location and UTC time setting
* Astroberry AltIMU - accelerometer, magnetometer, gyro, atmospheric pressure sensor driver
* Astroberry Board - power switch board allowing for remote powering on/off up to 4 devices and monitor system parameters

Changelog
============

indi_rpigs	-	Adding Polaris Hour Angle for easy polar alignment
indi_rpibrd	-	Shutdown button added for secure system power off

v1.0.1
indi_rpigps     -       FIX for gps reading freeze and full integration with gpsd service (required)
indi_rpifocus   -       FIX for lack of focuser status handling e.g. taking images during move
indi_rpifocus   -       FIX for inconsistences in focus direction
indi_rpifocus   -       disabling dualspeed mode. single speed mode only used (native)

v1.0
all		- Initial release of astroberry drivers

Requirements
============
* INDI available here http://indilib.org/download.html
* RTIMULib (for Astroberry AltIMU) available here https://github.com/richards-tech/RTIMULib
# bcm2835 (for Astroberry Focuser and Astroberry Board) available here http://www.airspayce.com/mikem/bcm2835/

Installation
============
See INSTALL

Source
===========

How to Use
==========
Once installed, the Astroberry INDI drivers can be used by an INDI client such as
KStars (Ekos) or OpenPHD. It can also be used manually by invoking it via the 
indi_server:
$ indi_server indi_rpialtimu indi_rpigps indi_rpifocus indi_rpibrd


Important!!!
============
Astroberry drivers are dedicated for controlling Raspberry Pi based devices. Drivers access various GPIO pins. Make sure 
that you use appropriate hardware devices connected to correct Raspberry Pi GPIO pins before running these drivers.
See Hardware specs below for detailed hardware and wiring instructions.

Hardware specs for Astroberry drivers
======================================
All devices have been connected to Raspberry Pi 2 running Raspbian Jenny or Ubuntu Mate

1. Astroberry Board
* Power switch board - YwRobot 4 relay connected to Raspberry Pi (40 GPIO pins available)
  GPIO05 - IN1
  GPIO06 - IN2
  GPIO13 - IN3
  GPIO26 - IN4
  Four IN pins, each switching ON/OFF a power line:
  * IN1 - 5V to any usb powered device (connecting to Raspberry Pi enables hard reset)
  * IN2 - 5V to any usb powered device
  * IN3 - 0-12V any special device e.g. DSLR - Canon EOS 600D requires 7,4V
  * IN4 - 12V any device such as NEQ6 mount
  Note: All inputs are set to HIGH by default. YwRobot board requires input to be LOW to swich ON a line.

2. Astroberry Focuser
* Stepper motor - PG2528-0502U 5V 0.2A 0,5Nm (with builtin gear 76:1)
* Stepper motor controller - Low-Voltage DRV8834 10,8V 2A.
  Wiring Raspberry Pi to the motor controller:
  GPIO04 - DIR
  GPIO17 - STEP
  GPIO22 - M0
  GPIO27 - M1
  GPIO23 - SLEEP
  Note: Make sure you connect the stepper motor correctly to the controller (B2, B1 and A2, A1 pins on the controller).
        Remember to protect the 5V power line connected to VMOT pin on the motor controller with 100uF capacitor.

3. Astroberry AltIMU
* AltIMU-10 v4 Gyro, Accelerometer, Compass, and Altimeter (L3GD20H, LSM303D, and LPS25H Carrier)
  Device connected to IÂ²C pins on Raspberry Pi:
  GPIO02 - SDA
  GPIO03 - SCL
  Note: Make sure that I2C is active on your Raspberry Pi (check with i2cdetect -y 1|0)

4. Astroberry GPS
* Adafruit Ultimate GPS MTK3339 (including RT clock with backup battery).
 Device wired to Raspberry Pi in the following way:
 GPIO14 - RX
 GPIO15 - TX
 GPIO23 - EN (not supported yet by driver)
 GPIO24 - PPS (not supported yet by driver)
